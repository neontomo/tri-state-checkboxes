# Tri-State Checkboxes

This project demonstrates the use of checkboxes with three states: empty, half-filled, and fully filled. It's implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Demo

https://neontomo.com/play/checkbox/

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the checkboxes and the JavaScript code to handle the checkbox state transitions.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the checkboxes and defines the visual representation of each state.
- `tri-state-checkboxes.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the checkbox state transitions.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code attaches click event listeners to the checkboxes. When a checkbox is clicked, its state is toggled by manipulating its CSS classes. The state transitions from empty to half-filled, from half-filled to fully filled, and from fully filled back to empty.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Adam Savage's use of checkboxes with three states: empty, half-filled, and fully filled. The idea is to visually represent the progress of a task using checkboxes, where each state corresponds to a different level of completion.
